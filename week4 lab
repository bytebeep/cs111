4. When you try to manipulate the float variable, be sure to pay attention to its scope of representation, which is exactly what it should be for any variable. Execute this code and observe what happened.



#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

	float a, b;

	a = 1234567890.0f;

	b = a + 20;

	printf("%f\n", a);

	printf("%f\n", b);

	return 0;

}



5. Practice the use of escape sequences. Escape sequences are a special class of symbols. Try to use \t,\n,\\,\? ,\' and others, observe the output result.


Hint: It is worth noting that you should try not to specify these characters when using scanf to input.







6. This is an important tip. Every time you enter a character, or any other variable, you leave a \n in the input stream. Then when you want to enter another char variable, the program will read this \n into it. So, the solution to this problem is to add a getchar() between the two scanfs to read away the \n. 

Try running the following two pieces of code and try to solve the problem.



	char a, b;

	a = getchar();

	b = getchar();

	printf("%c", a);

	printf("%c", b);





	char a;

	int c;

	scanf("%d", &c);

	b = getchar();

	printf("%d", c);

	printf("%c", b);
